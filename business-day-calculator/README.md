# Business Day Calculator

10/27/2019

Write a JS module or website which computes how many business days it takes to complete a project or task estimated at X amount of hours. There should be two inputs; a start date and number of hours. The output should be a date on which the project should be completed. 

**Rules**

* Assume each business day is 6 hours long (this is more realistic than 8).
* Weekends should NOT be counted as business days. 
* Assume we aren't considering about holidays and PTO days. 

**Example**

```
> Start Date - 10/25/2019
> Number of Hours - 280

> Output - 67 Calendar Days, Finish on 12/31/2019
```

**CHALLENGE ROUND**

* Compute holidays and factor them into the business day calculator. Use an external API or something similar to grab holiday dates. 

**SUPER INTENSE CHALLENGE ROUND***
* Create a way to save estimates and revisit them later. 
    * I should be able to name this estimate so I can track it easily. 
    * I should be able to review the estimate start day, hours/days progressed so far and the remaining time.
